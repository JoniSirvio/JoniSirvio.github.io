# Markdown assignment page

## The assignment was:

> **Free choice extra assignment bundle E**  
>  
> Use GitHub Pages and use markdown language syntax (not HTML) to create a static website.  
> Maybe you can host some WASM application there such as x86 emulation, Qt for WASM, or just Awesome WebAssembly Applications.  
> However, just a static website is also fine:  
>  
> - Website must be public  
> - Use at least handful of GitHub Flavour Markdown features to format the web page  
> - Document your work progress with few screenshots to the learning diary  
> - Write the GitHub page address to the learning diary so that your peer reviewers can verify it easily  
> - Keep the pages available until you have received your course grade  

### Now I have done this website and it includes all sorts of Markdown flavour features.
