Use Github Pages and use markdown language syntax (not HTML) to create a static website. Maybe you can host some WASM application there such as x86 emulation, Qt for WASM, or just Awesome WebAssembly Applications. However, just a static website is also fine:

Website must be public
Use at least handful of Github flavour markdown features to format the web page
Document your work progress with few screenshots to the learning diary
Write the Github page address to the learning diary so that your peer reviewers can verify it easily
Keep the pages available until you have received your course grade

### Now I have done this.
